## Introduction

[Jaws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaws_(film)) is a 1975 American thriller film directed by Steven Spielberg. In the film, a man-eating great white shark attacks beachgoers at a summer resort town, prompting police chief Martin Brody to hunt it. 

Considered one of the greatest films ever made, became the first film to earn $100 million in US and it was the highest-grossing film until the release of Star Wars in 1977. In 2001, it was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the United States National Film Registry as "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".

## Hypothesis

Due to the success of the movie Shark around the world, people began to fear more sharks. For this reason, more precautions were taken against them and the cases where a person was killed by a shark were reduced.

## Libraries

- Pandas
- Numpy

## Resources 

You can find the data with the globlal shark attack incidents [here](https://www.kaggle.com/teajay/global-shark-attacks/version/1).

## Data Processing

During the data processing, the years have been grouped into decades since 1930, because the attack record before that year cannot be reliable. 

The film was internationally successful, but most attacks occurred in the United States and Australia, so the same data has been analyzed several times in different ways, including the whole world, or only Australia and the United States
Also, the film is American, so perhaps the film had a biggest influence on society.

Finally, the 15 years previous to and after the movie have been selected to check whether the number of cases where a person was killed by a shark increased or decreased.

## Conclusions

The data shows us that mortality decrease globally in the years after the movie. Meanwhile, in the United States it had no influence, while in Australia the number of people killed by shark attacks increased.

In general, fatal cases decreased over the decades, so the influence of the film does not seem to be of great importance.

Also, the mortality in the United States and Australia is similar during the decades, although in the decade 2010's Australia suffers an increase in deaths.

## Study topics

From our results, the reason for this increase in cases in Australia during the 2010's could be studied.

Another issue to deal with would be if the provoked cases before and after the movies dropped.
